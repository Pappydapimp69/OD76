# OVERDRIVE 75

[Play OD75](https://pappydapimp69.github.io/OD75/)

## B98: Storm cloud cost

Each Thunderstorm cloud costs 8% of maximum HEAT; gathering pauses below 8%. Starting, each cloud and a full charge now flash and ring on screen, and the sky darkens as clouds gather. See [the B98 blueprint](docs/B98-storm-cloud-cost.md).

## B97: Sound Lab wallet home

The Notes / Sound Choices / Mix Choices row stays pinned while scrolling down, and returns to its home position whenever the top row of Pip Sounds is selected or scrolled back into. See [the B97 blueprint](docs/B97-sound-lab-wallet-home.md).

## B95: Heat readout

The skill button reads HEAT against the meter's maximum and fills with the whole meter. The top HEAT bar is a clear full-width gauge with a mark at the equipped skill's ignition point. See [the B95 blueprint](docs/B95-heat-readout.md).

## B94: Hold contract

Every skill ignites at 25% HEAT; Ascended Pip at 70%. Press fires, release ends, and a held skill keeps going below 25%. Beam and Guardian drain while held. Thunderstorm, Nova and Gravity Well charge while held, stop draining once full and strike only on release. Sound Lab audition buttons no longer show as blank white boxes. See [the B94 blueprint](docs/B94-hold-contract.md).

## B76: Pip notices

Pip learns within each run. Safe deliveries build confidence and commitment to fuller loads; rough trips create caution, favor safer heart sources and can lead to earlier returns. After a rough reunion he stays close briefly. Approach a burdened Pip steadily and he can recognize you coming, stop gathering and meet you with his cargo. Repeated halfway reunions make recognition faster.

His intentions appear beside him and his experiences are described in the existing pause view. Loving Rally and Supportive emergencies take priority. No new controls are required. ZaneGPT shaped this local emotional decision system; the game does not call a live language model. See [the B76 blueprint](docs/B76-pip-notices.md).

## B75: Immediate launch

The opening screen now keeps Start and Settings visible without scrolling at phone and desktop sizes. The goal and three controls are reduced to scan-level language while the original pointer, keyboard and controller routes remain unchanged. See [the B75 blueprint](docs/B75-launch-screen.md).

## B74: Heartfield

Ordinary enemies now drop zero to three heart value while preserving their previous average rewards. Two- and three-heart drops appear as layered clusters. After 2.25 seconds, nearby ordinary drops spiral into heart nodes holding up to eight hearts. Boss rewards remain individual hearts.

Pip picks up singles immediately and mines clusters or nodes one heart at a time. He chooses sources using value, distance and expiration pressure, keeps the existing one-heart cargo overflow, and banks each reunion as one clear delivery. Rally, Supportive emergency return, Ascended Pip, Gravity, Heart Relay, difficulty tiers and protected recovery caches share the same conserved heart accounting.

Open **Advanced Heartfield tuning** in Game Settings or pause Settings to change node radius, settle delay, node capacity and mining interval, or load Sparse, Balanced and Dense presets. See [the B74 blueprint](docs/B74-heartfield.md).

## B63: Partnership survival

Compassion adds 0.5 seconds of heart-meter duration per level instead of reducing
shield recharge delay. Supportive Pip drops cargo and immediately flies back
when shields fall below 2, using learned Pip attacks at orbit strength during
the return. He stays with you until shields recover to 2. Dropped hearts can be
recovered; they are not banked automatically. The 10% empty-heart speed penalty remains.

Stages 1–3 keep opening difficulty. Stages 4–10 gain one difficulty tier per
20 difficulty hearts, capped at tier 10. On entering stage 4, hearts banked in
stages 1–3 count at one-third value; subsequent hearts count normally. Spending hearts does not reduce
difficulty, and unbanked cargo does not increase it. Stage 11 onward resumes
the original stage/wave/boss scaling. See [the B63 blueprint](docs/B63-partnership-difficulty.md).

## B62: Lonely Pip

When Pip's heart meter is empty, he moves 10% slower after cargo slowdown.
The penalty applies while gathering and returning, and disappears as soon as
the meter has charge again. For example, 35% full-load speed becomes 31.5%
while lonely. Your saved movement settings remain in effect.

## B61: Movement settings

Open **Game settings** on the main screen or **Settings** in the Pip pause menu.
Adjust Pip's starting speed, Swift's flat and percentage increases and upgrade
pattern, the speed remaining at full cargo, and the player's normal top speed.
The table previews every Swift level before you press **Apply settings**.
Changes apply to the current run and save on this browser/device.

Use the **140 / +10 / 1% / 35% preset** to try alternating Swift growth, or
**Load B60 defaults** to restore the original movement. Press Apply after either.
With a controller, Y/Triangle opens main-screen settings; up/down selects controls,
left/right adjusts values, A selects buttons, and B/Start closes the menu.
See [the B61 blueprint](docs/B61-settings.md).

## B60: Heart transport

Pip carries hearts home in a loose cluster. Each heart weighs 3; starting
capacity is 10, and the last pickup may go slightly over. Full cargo halves
his flight speed. Move within 30px of Pip to bank his hearts early.

Heart Sense adds 2 capacity each level. Its range grows by 8px per level through
level 10, then 2px per level, capped at 200px. Swift Pip controls flight speed.
Heart Relay now lasts 0.5 seconds plus 0.1 per extra level, with an eight-second
trigger cooldown and a real delivery required.

Spend multiple Prism Seeds before choosing Continue. Sound Lab mixes now have
distinct recurring music parts in waves and boss fights, with free auditions.
Mix purchases automatically audition the changed part when audio is enabled.
See [the B60 blueprint](docs/B60-heart-transport.md).

## B59: Pip partnership

Raise Pip's emotional traits with Prism Seeds to develop three combat instincts:

- **Loving / Rally:** Pip returns as your bond weakens and briefly keeps it steady.
- **Compassionate / Cover:** nearby Pip intercepts a hit when you're vulnerable,
  then recharges. Watch the small blue recovery arc around Pip.
- **Supportive / Setup:** Pip prepares a gold diamond. Dash through it to finish
  a joint strike. Against Velvet Fang, Pip can draw its pounce; against Static
  Bloom, the diamond opens a passage through the petals.

Grump Star commits to aimed volleys, Velvet Fang stalks and pounces, and Static
Bloom fires petal patterns with visible gaps. Each develops a second phase.
Traits combine, and Ascended Pip amplifies the strongest learned instinct.

Move with WASD/arrows, the floating touch stick, or a controller. Dash with
Space, DASH, two taps/clicks toward a point, or the existing controller bindings.
Open the Pip pause view to inspect your learned instincts.

## Development

Requires Node 22 or newer.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8175/` for the assembled game. `/qa` adds local-only boss,
trait and input fixtures, plus the same checks used by CI. QA controls are never
included in the deployed site.

The Pages workflow assembles the numbered `b21-*.js` modules in order. B59 adds
`b21-46.js` (Pip decisions), `b21-47.js` (bosses) and `b21-48.js` (presentation and
the final simulation guard). See [the blueprint](docs/B59-partnership.md).
