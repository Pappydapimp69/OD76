# Handoff

You are taking over OD75. It tracks `https://github.com/Pappydapimp69/OD75`
on `main`; GitHub Pages deploys every push to `main`.

Read first:
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `PROJECT_MAP.md`
3. `TASKS.md`
4. `docs/AUTONOMOUS-BUILDS.md` — the progress authority for the 50-loop run

Then run:

```
brain status
brain query OD75
```

Use Brain through the CLI only. Do not read Brain node repos directly.
Brain mode is `full` and stance is `brief`.

Low context cost is deliberate: use `rg` before broad file reads, inspect only
task-relevant files, avoid whole-repo summaries unless asked, keep replies
terse.

Run `npm test` and `npm run build` before publishing any change.

## Toolchain

Node 22 or newer. `npm ci` installs the one dependency (jsdom).

**Claude Code / Linux** — the environment this is worked on in from B84.

- `npm ci && npm test && npm run build` need no environment overrides.
- Browser checks: Chromium is preinstalled at
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`. Drive it with
  `npm install --no-save playwright` and launch via `executablePath`; do not
  run `playwright install`. Keep the driver script out of the repo — the
  committed browser artifacts are the `tests/*-browser.js` fixtures.
- `node scripts/serve.mjs` serves `_site` on port 8175 and the local fixtures
  at `/qa`. Check whether a server is already running before starting one.
- The dev server has no favicon, so every page load logs one
  `/favicon.ico` 404. It is server noise, not an application error — filter it
  out of browser checks rather than chasing it.
- `brain gate` runs as a pre-commit hook and matches keywords against open
  tensions, so it can refuse an unrelated commit. Read the tension it names;
  if it genuinely does not touch the change, re-commit with
  `BRAIN_ACK=<slug> git commit ...` and say so.

**Codex / Windows** — how B77 to B83 were built.

- Set `NODE_PATH=C:/Users/Kompooter/Documents/OD75/node_modules` for the
  existing JSDOM dependency.
- Browser checks used CUA against the same `/qa` fixture buttons.

Either way: browser tests drive production-path fixture buttons, never
application-state injection from `evaluate`.

## Current state

B98 Storm Cloud Cost (`b21-87.js`) is the head. B91 Wave Closeout remains loop
15 of 50; B92–B98 were separate direct user requests. B93 release commit
`429b435c1459f8f0356821d380cf11476c53e295` deployed successfully in Pages
run `36095439314`; the public stamp, cache key and normalized assembled bundle
matched. No gameplay implementation is unfinished; select loop 16 / B99 next.

Suggested first action: read `TASKS.md`, check `git status` and the current
Pages run, and continue the listed step.
