# B63: Compassion, emergency support, and run-heart difficulty

Stages 1–3 hold opening difficulty: no wave-based speed, spawn, cap, health, composition, or boss-stat growth. Stages 4–10 use a virtual difficulty stage of 1 + floor(difficulty hearts / 20), capped at 10. Virtual wave is 1 + 3 * (virtual stage - 1); boss threat uses floor((virtual stage - 1) / 3). Wave kill targets are 8 in the opening stages and grow to 14 with heart tiers. Stage 11 onward uses the exact previous real-stage/total-wave/boss-count formulas. Existing enemy stats are not rewritten midlife; newly spawned enemies use current pressure. Each wave locks its kill target when it starts. Lifetime hearts, spent wallet balance, and unbanked cargo do not drive difficulty.

Compassion adds 0.5 seconds of away-time per level to the one-second base, replacing its shield recharge-delay reduction. Guard and other Compassion protection effects remain. Normalized heart values, instant mechanical reunion refill, and visual refill remain unchanged. Empty heart multiplies final cargo speed by 0.90, as in B62.

At Support level 1+, fewer than two shields overrides gathering and Rally: drop cargo as recoverable ground hearts, physically return, fire learned Pip attacks as if orbiting, and stay near the player until two shields recover. No teleport, free banking, duplicated pickups, bond restoration, or extra unlearned weapon. Dropped hearts receive a normal 10-second ground lifetime. Collection and magnet pickups remain blocked during the emergency. Learned Setup remains available after the emergency ends.

Validate stage boundaries, exact legacy formulas after 11, bank/spend/reset accounting, Compassion decay and Guard independence, physical emergency return, cargo conservation, learned shooting with an empty heart, pause, and recovery. Browser-check shop and pause descriptions on desktop/mobile. Playtest: tune the 20-heart tiers and +0.5-second Compassion increment if progression feels abrupt or too generous.

Stage-4 entry adjustment: capture hearts banked through stage 3 once. Difficulty hearts equal that opening count / 3 plus all hearts banked afterward. This never changes the wallet or run total.
