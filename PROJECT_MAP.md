# OD75 Project Map

## Purpose

Standalone OD75 game workspace with Brain/GitHub workflow intact and compact agent context. Built through Codex to B83, worked on in Claude Code from B84.

## Source Map

- `index.html`: base shell and original launch/stage/end markup.
- `b21-*.js`: lexically ordered gameplay modules and late overrides; see `docs/AUTONOMOUS-BUILDS.md` for the active release.
- `scripts/build.mjs`: syntax-checks and assembles `_site/game.js` with the release stamp.
- `tests/verify-b59.cjs`: complete JSDOM regression entrypoint.
- `tests/*-checks.js`: focused gameplay, settings, survival, Heartfield and launch contracts.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml`: test, assemble and deploy GitHub Pages.
- `docs/`: versioned build blueprints and pending state.
- `AGENTS.md`: agent operating instructions, environment-independent.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Brain-managed pointer created by `brain link`; do not edit manually.
- `TASKS.md`: active state and next work queue.
- `HANDOFF.md`: compact takeover context and the per-environment toolchain.
- `.brain/`: ignored local Brain link/cache.

## Brain State

- Mode: full
- Stance: brief
- Current issue: some global Brain proposals remain in intake/held state. OpenAI-owned fixed proposals are waiting on steward, not held.

## Current Build

B93 adds `b21-82.js`: Thunderstorm now gathers up to five clouds across a one-second hold, spends at most 20% HEAT, launches on release, seeks random targets and ricochets by Constellation level. Quick taps strike once without ricochet; a 1.25-second cooldown prevents spam. Regression and desktop/mobile browser fixtures cover charge, release, chaining, pause and focus loss.

B94 adds `b21-83.js`: every basic skill ignites at 25% HEAT and Ascended Pip at 70%. Beam and Guardian drain while held; Thunderstorm, Nova and Gravity Well charge while held, stop draining when full and strike on release. Sound Lab audition buttons get the game's button style.

B95 adds `b21-84.js`: the skill button reads HEAT against the meter maximum and fills with the whole meter; the top HEAT bar is a prominent gauge with an ignition mark.

B96 adds `b21-85.js`: the Sound Lab wallet row scrolls with the page instead of sticking to the top.

B97 adds `b21-86.js`: the Sound Lab wallet row pins again while scrolling down, and snaps home when the top Pip Sounds row is selected or scrolled back into.

B98 adds `b21-87.js`: Thunderstorm clouds cost 8% HEAT each, gathering pauses below 8%, and charging gets start/cloud/full flashes, a darkening sky and arcing lightning.

## Access Pattern

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_MAP.md`, `TASKS.md`, and the relevant blueprint.
2. Run one targeted `brain query` for the task.
3. Use `rg` before broad reads.
4. Run `npm test` and `npm run build` before publishing.
